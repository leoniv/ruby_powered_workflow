for access to 1C:Enterprise application code in runtime and its stored data;
- [ass_maintainer-info_base](https://github.com/leoniv/ass_maintainer-info_base) - abstraction for

# Ruby powered development workflow (RPDW)

It's extension of [RPW](https://github.com/leoniv/ruby_powered_workflow) for developers 1C:Enterprise software. It was extracted into separate term for improve understanding and reduce confusion.

There's only two main aspects of this:

- supporting 1C:Eneterprise software developers working process;
- testing of development 1C:Eneterprise software.

There's only two main things:

- [ass_devel](https://github.com/leoniv/ass_devel) - for automate working process;
- [ass_tests](https://github.com/leoniv/ass_tests) - for testing of 1C:Eneterprise software.

In future, possable, other needed things will be included in `ass_devel` and `ass_tests` namespaces.
